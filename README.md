#### My Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} str1
 * @param {string} str2
 * @return {string}
 */
var gcdOfStrings = function(str1, str2) {
    let smaller;
    let larger;
    let match = '';

    // Determine the smaller and larger strings to set loop bounds.
    if (str1.length > str2.length) {
        larger = str1;
        smaller = str2;
    } else {
        larger = str2;
        smaller = str1;
    }

    // Iterate through all possible prefixes of the smaller string.
    for (let i = 1; i <= smaller.length; i++) {
        let candidate = smaller.slice(0, i);
        
        // Check if the candidate prefix can form both strings by repeating.
        if (candidate.repeat(str1.length / candidate.length) === str1 && 
            candidate.repeat(str2.length / candidate.length) === str2) {
            // If it can, it's a valid common divisor. We keep the longest one found.
            match = candidate;
        }
    }
    return match;
};
```
### Complexity Analysis
- `Time Complexity`: O(min(N, M) * (N + M)), where N and M are the lengths of str1 and str2. The loop runs min(N, M) times. Inside the loop, repeat() and the string comparison can take up to O(N + M) time in each iteration, leading to a polynomial time complexity which can be slow for long strings.

- `Space Complexity`: O(N + M). The repeat() method can create new strings that are as long as the input strings, consuming significant space.

  > ```

</details>

#### My Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[]} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
var compress = function(chars) {
    // 'read' pointer scans the original array.
    let read = 0;
    // 'write' pointer indicates the position to write the compressed character/count to.
    let write = 0;

    while (read < chars.length) {
        let currentChar = chars[read];
        let count = 0;
        
        // Count consecutive occurrences of currentChar.
        while (read < chars.length && chars[read] === currentChar) {
            read++;
            count++;
        }
        
        // Write the character itself.
        chars[write] = currentChar;
        write++;
        
        // If the count is greater than 1, write the count as characters.
        if (count > 1) {
            let countString = count.toString();
            for (let i = 0; i < countString.length; i++) {
                chars[write] = countString[i];
                write++;
            }
        }
    }
    // 'write' is now the new length of the compressed array.
    return write;
};
```

> **Note on the if(count > 1) check:**
> This check is crucial. Without it, the function would incorrectly write the number '1' for single-character groups. This can cause a "runaway" issue where the `write` pointer exceeds the original bounds of relevant data, potentially overwriting characters that the `read` pointer hasn't processed yet, or in JavaScript, expanding the array.
> 
> **Example without the check:**
> If `chars = ["a", "b", "c"]`:
> 1. It processes "a", `count` is 1. It writes "a" at index 0, then writes "1" at index 1. `chars` becomes `["a", "1", "c"]`.
> 2. The `read` pointer is now at index 1 (which is now "1"), but it should be looking at the original "b". This leads to incorrect behavior.
>
> The `if (count > 1)` guard ensures that only counts for groups larger than one are written, which is the correct logic according to the problem description.

### Complexity Analysis
- `Time Complexity`: O(N), where N is the length of the `chars` array. Both the `read` and `write` pointers traverse the array at most once from beginning to end.

- `Space Complexity`: O(1). The compression is done in-place. The space used for variables like `count` and `countString` is mostly constant. For numbers like the index values and count, In most programming languages, a number variable uses a fixed amount of memory (e.g., 64 bits) regardless of whether it holds the value 5 or 5,000,000.

However, since countString is a string, its space complexity is proportional to its number of characters. This growth is logarithmic relative to the value of the count. For example:

If count is 9, countString is "9", which is 1 character long.
If count is 1000, countString is "1000", which is 4 characters long.
The space required grows with the number of digits, which is proportional to log10(count). In the worst-case scenario where count is roughly equal to N, the space complexity for this single variable is O(log N).

# `Dynamic Programming`

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful problem-solving technique used in computer science for optimization problems. The core idea is to break down a complex problem into simpler, overlapping subproblems. You solve each subproblem just once, store its solution, and then use these stored solutions to solve the larger problem.

It's different from simple recursion because it avoids re-calculating the same work over and over. It's different from a "greedy" approach because it considers the overall best path, not just the best immediate choice. 

This method is especially useful for optimization problems (like finding the maximum or minimum value) or counting problems (finding the number of ways to do something).


#### 1. Optimal Substructure
This means that the optimal solution to the main problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

#### 2. Overlapping Subproblems
This means that a simple recursive solution would end up solving the exact same subproblem multiple times. DP avoids this by storing the results. This storage is often called **memoization** (top-down approach) or **tabulation** (bottom-up approach).

### When should we think "Dynamic Programming"?

Look for problems that have these clues:
- The problem asks for a **maximum/minimum** value, the **number of ways** to do something, or if something is **possible**.
- You have to make a sequence of decisions at each step.
- A decision at one step affects the available choices at a later step.
- A "greedy" approach (always making the best local choice) fails.

  > You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.

# A Direct Guide to Domino and Tromino Tiling

The key to this problem is a systematic, step-by-step counting method. Instead of trying to find all tilings at once, we calculate the *number of ways* to tile a `2 x i` board by using the known counts for smaller boards (`2 x (i-1)`, `2 x (i-2)`, etc.). This is the essence of Dynamic Programming.

## Defining the States

To build our solution, we must identify all possible shapes of the tiled area's rightmost boundary. At any column `i`, there are only three possible states.

1.  **`full[i]`:** The number of ways to have a **perfectly tiled, rectangular** `2 x i` board.
    ```
           Column i
              â†“
      +-------+
      | X X X |
      +-------+
      | X X X |
      +-------+
    ```

2.  **`topEmpty[i]`:** The number of ways to tile a `2 x i` area, leaving the **top-right cell empty**.
    ```
           Column i
              â†“
      +-------+
      | X X X |  <-- Empty
      +-------+---+
      | X X X | X |
      +-------+---+
    ```

3.  **`bottomEmpty[i]`:** The number of ways to tile a `2 x i` area, leaving the **bottom-right cell empty**.
    ```
           Column i
              â†“
      +-------+---+
      | X X X | X |
      +-------+---+
      | X X X |  <-- Empty
      +-------+
    ```

These three state variables will store the counts we need to solve the problem. Our final goal is the value of `full[n]`.

## The Recurrence Relations (State Transitions)

These are the formulas that describe how to calculate the counts for a state at column `i` using the known counts from previous columns.

###â€¯CalculatingÂ `full[i]`Â (a perfectâ€¯`2Â Ã—Â i`â€¯board)

To count the ways to fill a full `2Â Ã—Â i` board, look at the **last tile(s) placed**.  
There are **four** possibilities:

| Step | Last action | Description | Contribution |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **A** | **Vertical domino** | Add one vertical domino to a perfect `2Â Ã—Â (iâ€¯âˆ’â€¯1)` board. | `full[iâ€‘1]` |
| **B** | **Two horizontal dominoes** | Add two horizontal dominoes to a perfect `2Â Ã—Â (iâ€¯âˆ’â€¯2)` board. | `full[iâ€‘2]` |
| **C** | **Tromino in a `topEmpty` gap** | Fill the lone empty topâ€‘right cell of a `topEmpty[iâ€‘1]` board with an Lâ€‘shaped tromino. | `topEmpty[iâ€‘1]` |
| **D** | **Tromino in a `bottomEmpty` gap** | Fill the lone empty bottomâ€‘right cell of a `bottomEmpty[iâ€‘1]` board the same way. | `bottomEmpty[iâ€‘1]` |


full[i] = full[i-1] + full[i-2] + topEmpty[i-1] + bottomEmpty[i-1]

---

###â€¯CalculatingÂ `topEmpty[i]`Â andÂ `bottomEmpty[i]`Â (incomplete boards)

####â€¯`topEmpty[i]` â€“ only the topâ€‘right cell is empty

| Step | Last action | Contribution |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **A** | Place a tromino on a `full[iâ€‘2]` board (covers both cells in columnâ€¯`iâ€‘1` and bottom cell in columnâ€¯`i`). | `full[iâ€‘2]` |
| **B** | Place a horizontal domino on a `bottomEmpty[iâ€‘1]` board (covers top cells of columnsâ€¯`iâ€‘1` andâ€¯`i`). | `bottomEmpty[iâ€‘1]` |


topEmpty[i] = full[i-2] + bottomEmpty[i-1]


---

###â€¯BaseÂ Cases

| `i` | `full[i]` | `gap[i]` |
|-----|-----------|----------|
|â€¯0â€¯|â€¯1â€¯|â€¯0â€¯|
|â€¯1â€¯|â€¯1â€¯|â€¯0â€¯|

`full[0]â€¯=â€¯1`  (empty board),  
`full[1]â€¯=â€¯1`  (one vertical domino),  
`gap[0]â€¯=â€¯gap[1]â€¯=â€¯0`  (impossible to leave a corner empty).
