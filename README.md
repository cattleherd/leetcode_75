#### My Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} str1
 * @param {string} str2
 * @return {string}
 */
var gcdOfStrings = function (str1, str2) {
  let smaller;
  let larger;
  let match = "";

  // Determine the smaller and larger strings to set loop bounds.
  if (str1.length > str2.length) {
    larger = str1;
    smaller = str2;
  } else {
    larger = str2;
    smaller = str1;
  }

  // Iterate through all possible prefixes of the smaller string.
  for (let i = 1; i <= smaller.length; i++) {
    let candidate = smaller.slice(0, i);

    // Check if the candidate prefix can form both strings by repeating.
    if (
      candidate.repeat(str1.length / candidate.length) === str1 &&
      candidate.repeat(str2.length / candidate.length) === str2
    ) {
      // If it can, it's a valid common divisor. We keep the longest one found.
      match = candidate;
    }
  }
  return match;
};
```

### Complexity Analysis

- `Time Complexity`: O(min(N, M) \* (N + M)), where N and M are the lengths of str1 and str2. The loop runs min(N, M) times. Inside the loop, repeat() and the string comparison can take up to O(N + M) time in each iteration, leading to a polynomial time complexity which can be slow for long strings.

- `Space Complexity`: O(N + M). The repeat() method can create new strings that are as long as the input strings, consuming significant space.

  > Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"]
  > ```

</details>

#### My Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[]} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
var compress = function (chars) {
  // 'read' pointer scans the original array.
  let read = 0;
  // 'write' pointer indicates the position to write the compressed character/count to.
  let write = 0;

  while (read < chars.length) {
    let currentChar = chars[read];
    let count = 0;

    // Count consecutive occurrences of currentChar.
    while (read < chars.length && chars[read] === currentChar) {
      read++;
      count++;
    }

    // Write the character itself.
    chars[write] = currentChar;
    write++;

    // If the count is greater than 1, write the count as characters.
    if (count > 1) {
      let countString = count.toString();
      for (let i = 0; i < countString.length; i++) {
        chars[write] = countString[i];
        write++;
      }
    }
  }
  // 'write' is now the new length of the compressed array.
  return write;
};
```

> **Note on the if(count > 1) check:**
> This check is crucial. Without it, the function would incorrectly write the number '1' for single-character groups. This can cause a "runaway" issue where the `write` pointer exceeds the original bounds of relevant data, potentially overwriting characters that the `read` pointer hasn't processed yet, or in JavaScript, expanding the array.
>
> **Example without the check:**
> If `chars = ["a", "b", "c"]`:
>
> 1. It processes "a", `count` is 1. It writes "a" at index 0, then writes "1" at index 1. `chars` becomes `["a", "1", "c"]`.
> 2. The `read` pointer is now at index 1 (which is now "1"), but it should be looking at the original "b". This leads to incorrect behavior.
>
> The `if (count > 1)` guard ensures that only counts for groups larger than one are written, which is the correct logic according to the problem description.

### Complexity Analysis

- `Time Complexity`: O(N), where N is the length of the `chars` array. Both the `read` and `write` pointers traverse the array at most once from beginning to end.

- `Space Complexity`: O(1). The compression is done in-place. The space used for variables like `count` and `countString` is mostly constant. For numbers like the index values and count, In most programming languages, a number variable uses a fixed amount of memory (e.g., 64 bits) regardless of whether it holds the value 5 or 5,000,000.

However, since countString is a string, its space complexity is proportional to its number of characters. This growth is logarithmic relative to the value of the count. For example:

If count is 9, countString is "9", which is 1 character long.
If count is 1000, countString is "1000", which is 4 characters long.
The space required grows with the number of digits, which is proportional to log10(count). In the worst-case scenario where count is roughly equal to N, the space complexity for this single variable is O(log N).

# `Dynamic Programming`

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful problem-solving technique used in computer science for optimization problems. The core idea is to break down a complex problem into simpler, overlapping subproblems. You solve each subproblem just once, store its solution, and then use these stored solutions to solve the larger problem.

It's different from simple recursion because it avoids re-calculating the same work over and over. It's different from a "greedy" approach because it considers the overall best path, not just the best immediate choice.

This method is especially useful for optimization problems (like finding the maximum or minimum value) or counting problems (finding the number of ways to do something).

#### 1. Optimal Substructure

This means that the optimal solution to the main problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

#### 2. Overlapping Subproblems

This means that a simple recursive solution would end up solving the exact same subproblem multiple times. DP avoids this by storing the results. This storage is often called **memoization** (top-down approach) or **tabulation** (bottom-up approach).

### When should we think "Dynamic Programming"?

Look for problems that have these clues:

- The problem asks for a **maximum/minimum** value, the **number of ways** to do something, or if something is **possible**.
- You have to make a sequence of decisions at each step.
- A decision at one step affects the available choices at a later step.
- A "greedy" approach (always making the best local choice) fails.

### 2. Domino Tromino <a name="Domino Tromino"></a>

**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Link:** [LeetCode Problem 790](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)


The key to this problem is a systematic, step-by-step counting method. Instead of trying to find all tilings at once, we calculate the _number of ways_ to tile a `2 x i` board by using the known counts for smaller boards (`2 x (i-1)`, `2 x (i-2)`, etc.). This is the essence of Dynamic Programming.

## Defining the States

To build our solution, we must identify all possible shapes of the tiled area's rightmost boundary. At any column `i`, there are only three possible states.

1.  **`full[i]`:** The number of ways to have a **perfectly tiled, rectangular** `2 x i` board.

    ```
           Column i
              â†“
      +-------+
      | X X X |
      +-------+
      | X X X |
      +-------+
    ```

2.  **`topEmpty[i]`:** The number of ways to tile a `2 x i` area, leaving the **top-right cell empty**.

    ```
           Column i
              â†“
      +-------+
      | X X X |  <-- Empty
      +-------+---+
      | X X X | X |
      +-------+---+
    ```

3.  **`bottomEmpty[i]`:** The number of ways to tile a `2 x i` area, leaving the **bottom-right cell empty**.
    ```
           Column i
              â†“
      +-------+---+
      | X X X | X |
      +-------+---+
      | X X X |  <-- Empty
      +-------+
    ```

These three state variables will store the counts we need to solve the problem. Our final goal is the value of `full[n]`.

## The Recurrence Relations (State Transitions)

These are the formulas that describe how to calculate the counts for a state at column `i` using the known counts from previous columns.

To count the ways to fill a full `2Â Ã—Â i` board, look at the **last tile(s) placed**.  
There are **four** possibilities:

| Step  | Last action                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                 | Contribution       |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **A** | **Vertical domino**                | We can create a full[i] perfect 2 x i board by placing one vertical domino to a full[i-1] `2Â Ã—Â (iâ€¯âˆ’â€¯1)` board. Thus we must consider the full[i-1] permutation.             | `full[iâ€‘1]`        |
| **B** | **Two horizontal dominoes**        | We can create a full[i] perfect 2 x i board by placing two horizontal dominoes to a perfect full[i-2] `2Â Ã—Â (iâ€¯âˆ’â€¯2)` board. Thus we must consider the full[i-2] permutation. | `full[iâ€‘2]`        |
| **C** | **Tromino in a `topEmpty` gap**    | We can create a full[i] perfect 2 x i board by placing a tromino block on a `topEmpty[i-1]` board with an Lâ€‘shaped tromino.                                                 | `topEmpty[iâ€‘1]`    |
| **D** | **Tromino in a `bottomEmpty` gap** | We can create a full[i] perfect 2 x i board by placing a tromino block on `bottomEmpty[iâ€‘1]` board the same way.                                                            | `bottomEmpty[iâ€‘1]` |

  topfill[1] = 0; // Impossible to leave a top gap.

  // Iterate from i = 2 up to n, building the solution from the base cases.

    // Calculate the number of ways to fully tile a 2 x i board.
    full[i] =
      (full[i - 1] + full[i - 2] + topfill[i - 1] + bottomfill[i - 1]) % MOD;

### My Thought Process & Solution Strategy

My approach to solving this problem was to identify a pattern and build the solution from the ground up. This is a classic **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming** strategy.

1.  **Core Insight:** The key constraint is that the robot can only move **Down** or **Right**. This immediately told me that to reach any given cell `(r, c)`, the robot must have arrived from either the cell directly above, `(r-1, c)`, or the cell directly to the left, `(r, c-1)`.

2.  **The Recurrence Relation:** Based on that insight, I formulated the central rule for this problem: The total number of unique paths to any cell is the sum of the paths to the cell above and the cell to the left.

    - `paths(r, c) = paths(r-1, c) + paths(r, c-1)`

3.  **Identifying the Base Cases:** I then considered the "easiest" parts of the grid. For any cell in the very first row, there is only one way to get there: moving right continuously from the start. The same is true for the very first column, where the only way is to move down continuously. This means every cell in the top row and left column represents exactly **1** unique path.

4.  **The DP Matrix Plan:** With the rule and the base cases defined, I planned my algorithm:
    - Create an `m x n` matrix (a 2D array, `dp`) to store the number of paths to each cell.
    - Initialize the matrix to handle the base cases. A simple way to do this is to set all values in the first row and first column to `1`.
    - Iterate through the rest of the matrix, starting from `dp[1][1]`.
    - Apply my recurrence relation (`dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`) to fill in each cell based on the values I've already computed.
    - The final answer is the value stored in the bottom-right corner, `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

### Final JavaScript Code

This code implements the bottom-up DP strategy.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var uniquePaths = function(m, n) {
    // Edge case: If the grid is just a single row or column, there's only one path.
    if (m === 1 || n === 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // Step 1: Create the DP matrix.
    // I'm initializing the entire m x n grid with 1s. This is a clean way to
    // set up the base cases, since every cell in the first row and first
    // column should have a value of 1.
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(1));

    // Step 2: Fill the rest of the grid using the recurrence relation.
    // Start iterating from (1, 1) since the 0-th row and 0-th column are
    // already correctly initialized as our base cases.
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            // Apply the core rule: paths to here = paths from above + paths from left.
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        }
    }

    // Step 3: The final answer is stored in the bottom-right cell.
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
};
```

### My Thought Process & Solution Strategy

This problem is a quintessential **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming** problem. A brute-force approach of generating all subsequences would be far too slow (exponential time). DP allows us to build the solution efficiently.

1.  **Core Insight:** The problem can be broken down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. The LCS of two long strings depends on the LCS of shorter versions of those same strings. This structure is a perfect fit for a DP matrix (or 2D array).

2.  **The DP Matrix Plan:** My central idea was to create a 2D grid, `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the Longest Common Subsequence for the prefixes `text1.substring(0, i)` and `text2.substring(0, j)`. The grid dimensions would be `(text1.length + 1) x (text2.length + 1)` to account for empty string prefixes.

3.  **The Recurrence Relation (The Two Golden Rules):** I then determined how to fill each cell `dp[i][j]` by looking only at its neighbors. This involved comparing the characters `text1[i-1]` and `text2[j-1]`:
    *   **Case 1: The characters match.** This is the "happy path." We've found a character that can extend our subsequence. The length is `1` plus the length of the LCS of the strings *before* these characters. This pre-computed answer is always stored in the diagonal cell: `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
        *   **Rule:** `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`
    *   **Case 2: The characters do NOT match.** We can't extend the subsequence with the current characters. The best we can do is carry forward the longest subsequence found so far. This means taking the maximum length from either the subproblem without `text1`'s current character (the cell to the left, `dp[i][j-1]`) or the subproblem without `text2`'s current character (the cell above, `dp[i-1][j]`). This is the "messenger propagation" rule.
        *   **Rule:** `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`

4.  **Identifying the Base Cases:** The "easiest" subproblem is finding the LCS between a string and an empty string. The answer is always 0. By creating a grid one size larger than the strings and initializing it with zeros, the entire first row and first column automatically represent these base cases correctly.

5.  **Final Answer:** After applying these rules iteratively to every cell in the grid, the problem for the full strings will be solved. The final answer will be stored in the bottom-right corner of the grid, `dp[text1.length][text2.length]`.

### Final JavaScript Code

This code implements the bottom-up DP strategy discussed above.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} text1
 * @param {string} text2
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestCommonSubsequence = function(text1, text2) {
    const m = text1.length;
    const n = text2.length;

    // Step 1: Create the DP matrix with +1 size for the empty string base cases.
    // It is initialized with all 0s, which correctly handles the base cases
    // where either string is empty.
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));


            /*      
                    ''  a   b   a  text1 = aba
                ''  0   0   0   0
  text2 = dbab  d   0   0   0   0
                b   0   0   1   0
                a   0   0   1   1
                b   0   1   2   2
                
            */

    // Step 2: Iterate through the grid, starting from (1, 1).
    // The loops fill the grid based on the two rules.
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            // Get the characters corresponding to the current subproblem.
            // We use i-1 and j-1 because strings are 0-indexed.
            const char1 = text1[i - 1];
            const char2 = text2[j - 1];

            // Step 3: Apply the recurrence relation.
            if (char1 === char2) {
                // Rule 1 (Match): Add 1 to the result from the diagonal.
                // The diagonal is the largest subsequence at a given substr
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                // Rule 2 (No Match): Propagate the best result from above or left. This means u aren't extending the largest subsequence.

                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 4: The final answer is in the bottom-right corner.
    return dp[m][n];

};
```

-  The largest subsequence at each point is at the bottom right. For example, largest subsequence of ab and dbab is 2.
- likewise, the largest subsequence of aba and dbab is 2 as well. since you dont match on the last letter, just propogate 2 to the right, which propogates largest subsequence from the last 2 substr comparisons.

### My Thought Process & Solution Strategy

This problem is a classic application of **State Machine Dynamic Programming**. A simple greedy approach like "buy lowest, sell highest" fails because it doesn't account for multiple profitable "waves" or transaction fees invalidating small gains. The key is to realize that on any given day, we can only be in one of two states.

1.  **Core Insight:** At the end of any given day, my financial status can be described in one of two ways: I am either **holding a stock**, or I have **cash on hand (no stock)**. The goal is to maximize my net worth in both of these states every single day.

2.  **The State Variables:** My strategy revolves around tracking two variables as I iterate through the prices:
    *   `hold`: Represents the maximum possible net worth if I end the day **holding** one share of stock. This value carries the "memory" of my past transactions.
    *   `cash`: Represents the maximum possible profit if I end the day **not holding** a stock. This is my realized, spendable profit.

3.  **The Recurrence Relation (The Two Golden Rules):** To find the values for the current day, I only need the values from the previous day. This leads to two simple rules for updating my state:
    *   **Rule 1: Calculating the new `cash` value.** To have cash today, I could have either (a) carried over my cash from yesterday, or (b) sold the stock I was holding yesterday. I choose the more profitable option.
        *   `new_cash = max( yesterday's_cash, yesterday's_hold + today's_price - fee )`
    *   **Rule 2: Calculating the new `hold` value.** To be holding a stock today, I could have either (a) kept holding the stock from yesterday, or (b) used my cash from yesterday to buy a stock today. I choose the more profitable option.
        *   `new_hold = max( yesterday's_hold, yesterday's_cash - today's_price )`

4.  **Identifying the Base Cases:** Before the first day, my net worth is 0 and I hold no stock. So, to start the process for Day 0:
    *   Initial `cash` = `0`
    *   Initial `hold` = `-prices[0]` (I used my 0 cash to buy the first stock).

5.  **Final Answer:** After iterating through all the days, the final answer must be the `cash` value. I cannot end with a stock in hand, as profit is only realized upon selling.

```js
// At the final state, you can either be holding stock or not

// max profit holding stock

// 1) carried over stock from yesterday
// 2) i bought stock

//max profit holding no stock

//1) sold my stock today
//2) carried over my cash

//Day 1 stock[0] = 1
// 1)  - net worth hold stock: Max( yesterdays hold value, hold value when buying stock with yesterday's cash )
//     - Max( -infinity , 0 - 1 ) => Max(-infinity, -1) => -1
// 2)  - net worth no stock: Max(yesterdays cash value, cash value selling yesterdays stock)
//     - Max( 0 , -infinity + 1 - 2 ) => Max(0, -infinity) => 0

//Day 2 stock[1] = 3

// 1) - net worth hold stock: Max( yesterdays hold value, hold value when buying stock with yesterday's cash )
//    - Max(-1, 0-3 = -3) => -1
//
// 2) - net worth no stock: Max(yesterdays cash value, cash value selling yesterdays stock)
//    - Max( 0, 3-1-2 = 0) = 0

//Day 3 stock[2] = 2
// 1) - net worth hold stock: Max( yesterdays hold value, hold value when buying stock with yesterday's cash )
//    - Max(-1, 0 - 2 = -2) => -1 
//    We propogate the lowest buying price of a stock.
//
// 2) - net worth no stock: Max(yesterdays cash value, cash value selling yesterdays stock)
//    - Max( 0, (2 - 1) - 2) => 0 
//     We propogate the best selling price, or just carry cash over

// Day 4 stock[3] = 8
// 1) - net worth hold stock: Max( yesterdays hold value, hold value when buying stock with yesterday's cash )
//    - Max( -1, 0-8 = -8)=> -1
// 2) - net worth no stock: Max(yesterdays cash value, cash value selling yesterdays stock)
//    - Max(0, (8-1)-2)  => 5! new max.
//
//  So we propogate the lowest buying price of a stock, which is still -1
//  However, we found a new global max of holding cash, its best to sell yesterdays stock rather than hold onto yesterdays cash.


// Day 5 stock[4] = 4
// 1) - net worth hold stock: Max( yesterdays hold value, hold value when buying stock with yesterday's cash )
//    - Max( -1, 5-4 = 1)=> 1
// Key moment, better to hold new stock (implying sold first stock for profit earlier. Now we have positive net worth holding a stock from previous sell at 8). Reinvesting our profits for potential future gains.
// 2) - net worth no stock: Max(yesterdays cash value, cash value selling yesterdays stock)
//    - Max(5, (4-1)-2)  => 5. We propogate the global gainz of selling at 8 (bought at 1).

// Day 6 stock[5] = 9
// 1) - net worth hold stock: Max( yesterdays hold value, hold value when buying stock with yesterday's cash )
//    - Max(1, 5-9 = -4)=> 1
//   We propogate the highest net worth of holding a stock, which is still 1 (bought at 4, sold at 5.)
// 2) - net worth no stock: Max(yesterdays cash value, cash value selling yesterdays stock)
//    - Max(5, (9+1)-2)  => 8. New global max. 
// we realized best to buy at 1, sell at 8, then buy at 4, sell at 9. Rather than just keep profit at 5 (buy 1 sell at 8)
